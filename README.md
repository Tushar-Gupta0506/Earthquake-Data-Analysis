#### Description:
This project involves a detailed analysis of earthquake data for the years 2022-2023. The dataset, containing information on earthquake occurrences, magnitudes, and dates, is loaded from an Excel file. Utilizing Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the analysis aims to uncover patterns and insights from the earthquake data.

#### Objectives:
1. **Statistical Distribution of Earthquake Magnitudes**:
   - **Objective**: To visualize and understand the statistical distribution of earthquake magnitudes.
   - **Method**: A histogram with a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) overlay will be plotted to display the frequency and distribution of earthquake magnitudes.

2. **Changes in Earthquake Magnitude with Respect to Month**:
   - **Objective**: To observe and interpret any patterns or trends in earthquake magnitudes across different months.
   - **Method**: By converting the date of each earthquake event to a datetime format and extracting the month, a bar plot will be created to show the mean earthquake magnitude for each month.

3. **Detection of Outliers in Earthquake Magnitudes**:
   - **Objective**: To identify and confirm the presence of outliers in the earthquake magnitudes.
   - **Method**: A boxplot will be used to display the distribution of earthquake magnitudes and highlight any outliers.

#### Steps of Analysis:
1. **Import Necessary Libraries**:
   - Libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn will be imported for data manipulation and visualization.

2. **Load the Earthquake Dataset**:
   - The dataset will be loaded from an Excel file into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.

3. **Visualize the Distribution of Earthquake Magnitudes**:
   - A histogram with KDE will be plotted to show the distribution of earthquake magnitudes.

4. **Analyze Changes in Earthquake Magnitude by Month**:
   - The 'Date' column will be converted to a datetime format, the month will be extracted, and a bar plot will be created to observe changes in mean earthquake magnitude across months.

5. **Identify Outliers in Earthquake Magnitudes**:
   - A boxplot will be generated to confirm the presence of outliers in the dataset.
